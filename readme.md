As a modern software engineer, I practice often with frameworks to expand my knowledge and develop a track record of working with code bases and developing useful software. I frequently work on projects that challenge my abilities.

This hello world console application is simple. It is written in C# and the .NET framework.

The purpose of this application is to showcase my ability to follow directions and establish a portfolio.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
